# SegmentAnalysis

A repository for conducting analysis on segements generated by `TwoPaCo` on bacterial genomes obtained from RefSeq.

## Step 0: clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/dombraccia/SegmentAnalysis.git
cd SegmentAnalysis
```

## Step 1: external requirments

TODO: External tools and requirements 

## Step 2: getting data 

Data comes from previous analysis. Contact @dombraccia for more information.

## Step 3: processing reference genomes -> segments

TODO: Add steps here

## Step 4: running `pipeline.sh`

The `code/pipeline.sh` script contains all the steps necessary to regenerate the analysis of genomic segments. It is recommended that the pipeline script be run on a remote server or cluster system with high performance processing power:

```
# from project ~ dir:
bash code/pipeline.sh
```
