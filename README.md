# SegmentAnalysis

A repository for conducting analysis on segements generated by `TwoPaCo` on bacterial genomes obtained from RefSeq.

## Step 0: clone repo & set up conda envs
```
git clone https://github.com/dombraccia/SegmentAnalysis.git
cd SegmentAnalysis
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Step 1: external requirments

Setting up `TwoPaCo` - see `TwoPaCo`'s [README](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo) on their github for 
```
mkdir external
cd external
## Follow instructions in TwoPaCo README file on their github (linked above)
```

## Step 2: `Snakemake`

Most all of the data downloading, pre-processing and analysis steps are inlcuded in the Snakefile in the project home directory. Each script was written to run from the `snakemake` command in the project home directory, so they will likely not work if run on their own. See steps below for using the Snakefile to produce any of the results presented in the paper.

```
snakemake -p <> 
```
